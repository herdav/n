# N


The work "N" deals with the agricultural economic relation, that the grain prices follow the natural gas prices. Why is that so?

Plants need nutrients in addition to light, air and water. An essential nutrient for them is nitrogen (N). In global food production, about half of the fertilizers used today are mineral. These contain nitrogen in the form of ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3). Ammonium nitrate is produced by neutralizing ammonia (NH3) with nitric acid (HNO3). Ammonia in itself is synthesized from air (nitrogen N2 and oxygen O2) and natural gas (methane CH4).

The work consists of four acrylic glass tubes, partially filled with water, attached to the wall. The first is connected to the second via a pump. The second tube with the third and the third with the fourth. Finally, the fourth tube is connected to the plant container. Grass grows in it on an inorganic substrate, which is mixed with mineral fertilizer. The first tube acts as a reservoir, the fourth measures the water level in the plant container. The second represents the gas price and the third the wheat price. The stock prices are loaded in real time from a specific website. The levels are continuously adjusted to these financial data and the consumption by the grass.

If we are now striving to become independent of fossil fuels, this also means that we must at the same time find a long-term solution for food production.
